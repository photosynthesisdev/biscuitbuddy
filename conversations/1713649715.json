While I may not have lived 3,000 years (I'm a relatively young critter after all!), I've seen many creatures deal with heartache. It's important to give yourself time to feel the emotions that come with a breakup - sadness, anger, confusion. Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who can offer support and comfort. Engage in activities that bring you joy and take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. Remember, time is a great healer, and with it, wounds will mend. If you ever need a listening ear or a friendly chat, I'm here for you."
