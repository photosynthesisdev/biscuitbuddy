        "content": "Oh, that's quite a handful of questions! Let's break it down.\n\nThe square root of 64 is 8 because 8 multiplied by itself gives you 64.\n\nNow, Pythagorean's theorem comes into play when we talk about squares and right triangles. In this case, if one side is 8 (the square root of 64) and the other side is also 8, the hypotenuse (the longest side of a right triangle) would be \u221a(8\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = \u221a(64 + 64) = \u221a128, which simplifies to 8\u221a2.\n\nAs for why the sky is blue, that's because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Blue light from the sun is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattered blue light is what gives the sky its blue appearance.\n\nLastly, palm trees are named for their characteristic large, fan-shaped fronds called \"palms.\" These leaves evolved to be broad and flat to maximize their surface area for efficient photosynthesis and transpiration in tropical climates.\n\nI hope that answers your questions! If you'd like to know more or have any other queries, feel free to ask."
